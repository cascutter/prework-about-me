      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a 15 year veteran of the beauty industry and have been a salon owner for the past four. 
        My time in the industry has allowed me to connect with and understand people of all backgrounds 
        in an intimate way and I hope to bring that special skill with me as I embark on a new career.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born and raised in Albuquerque, New Mexico.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I'm a self-proclaimed hobby collector. My most current endeavors are tending to my vegetable garden,
        skateboarding, cooking, crochet, dangling things in front of my cats, and yoga.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream is to feel impactful, fulfilled, and at peace, in whatever form that may come.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>San Antonio, Texas</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>From waaaay back in the MySpace days of fiddling with html to make my page hella sweet, I've been 
        interested in learning more about coding and web development. I'm happy to finally be here, even later
        in life, completely invested and ready to do the dang thing.</p>
